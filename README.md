Tkinter-based Python GUI for Youtube-DL

It's been a while since I've used Python, and I've never used it for something like this.
I'm also using this project to learn Git and GitHub, so forgive any shenanigans occurring in here.

As far as I can tell, this is how the process of development with Git goes:

Ctrl+Shift+P --> opens VSCode's (Git?) command line

1. Beginning of Session

    ```git fetch```

      (or ```git pull``` + ```git merge```) 
     
      Do this in the branch you're working on

2. Actual coding

    do whatever development you're doing (in the branch you're working on)

3. Updating your changes

    ```git add <filename>``` (or hit the "+" on VSCode)

    ```git commit -m "Message you want to include with commit" ``` 
        (or use the Ctrl+Enter thing in VSCode)

    ```git push```

4. Merging branches

    ```git merge <some other branch>```
       
    (merges some other branch with the one you're in)
