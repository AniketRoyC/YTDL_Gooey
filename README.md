I'm using this project to also learn to use Git and GitHub, so forgive any shnanigans occurring in here.

As far as I can tell, this is how the process of development with Git goes:

1.Beginning of Session
    git fetch  (or pull+merge) in the branch you're working on
2.Actual coding
    do whatever development you're doing (in the branch you're working on)
3.Updating your changes
    git add <filename> (or hit the "+" on VSCode)
    git commit -m "Message you want to include"
    git push
4. Merging branches
    git merge <some other branch>
        (merges some other branch with the one you're in)
